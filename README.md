# Data Structures and Algorithms

This project is a casual aside for me to practice and develop a deeping understanding of data structures and algorithms. There will be a component of visualization included.

## Data Structures

This section is for describing different data structures.

### Nodes

From *structures/nodes.py*.

Nodes are among the most basic of structures. A node is a structure which contains data and one or more links (pointers) to other nodes. When a node is linked to a null value this is a terminal node.

### Linked Lists

From *structures/linkedList.py*

A linked list is a structure which contains a series of linked nodes. In the case of a singly linked list, such as the one implemented here, nodes can be added to the head, or removed from the list.

### Doubly Linked List

From *structures/doublyLinkedList.py*

A doubly linked list is a bidirectional series of linked nodes. The list can be traversed from head to tail or vice versa. Items can be appended to the head or tail of the list.
