# Data Structures and Algorithms

This project is a casual aside for me to practice and develop a deeping understanding of data structures and algorithms. There will be a component of visualization included.

## Data Structures

This section is for describing different data structures.

### Nodes

From *structures/nodes.py*.
Nodes are among the most basic of structures. A node is a structure which contains data and one or more links (pointers) to other nodes. When a node is linked to a null value this is a terminal node.
